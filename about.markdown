# About

> As we go marching, marching, in the beauty of the day<br>
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray<br>
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses<br>
For the people hear us singing, bread and roses, bread and roses.

â€”[Bread &amp; Roses union song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_Roses)

## Mission

Flowers to the People sows the seeds of social justice and helps them bloom. We encourage donations to local social justice organizations in Boston, Massachusetts through growing and distributing free flowers. Instead of Community Supported Agriculture, we practice Community Solidarity Agriculture, where the community support those among us most in need of support.

## Vision

Flowers have long represented the beauty and joy we all need to thrive. We imagine a world where struggle is met and undone with beauty, creativity, and joy. Like the women of the [Bread & Roses strike of 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Lawrence_textile_strike), we imagine a world where there there is an abundance of bread and roses: both sustenance and beauty.
