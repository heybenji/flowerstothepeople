# About

## Mission

{{ site.description }} Instead of Community <em>Supported</em> Agriculture, we practice Community <em>Solidarity</em> Agriculture, where the community supports those among us most in need of support.

## Vision

Flowers have long represented the beauty and joy we all need to thrive. We imagine a world where oppression is met and undone with beauty, creativity, and joy. Like the women of the [Bread & Roses strike of 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Lawrence_textile_strike), we imagine a world where there there is an abundance of bread and roses: both sustenance and beauty.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who's behind this?

We're just a handful of neighbors in Boston who are excited about flowers and activism, volunteering our time to spread some beauty and raise money for local social justice organizations.

### How can I get involved?

There are four ways you can get involved:
1. Volunteer to harvest and distribute bouquets
1. Donate when you receive a bouquet
1. Donate to pick up a Community Solidarity Agriculture share on harvest days
1. Help clean up and divide tubers in the fall
